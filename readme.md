# The Hit Formula: Spotify Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Spotify data to determine if audio features, like tempo, key, and loudness that correlate with commercial success.

## Key Findings
- Songs are getting shorter, averaging about 3.5 mins.
- Explicit tracks perform slightly better than clean ones.
- Audio features alone are not enough to predict a "Hit" (R-squared is low).

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
